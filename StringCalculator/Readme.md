Design Patterns

Q1 Name favourate 3 design patterns

1. Factory Pattern
2. Strategy Pattern
3. Builder Pattern

Q2. Explain the use of the pattern chosen

I choose the Factory Pattern as it offsets the instanstiation of of a class to a factory class that sole purpose is the return a class of type requested.
This is useful as it doesnt clog up the current running of the code and allows for loose coupling of classes
